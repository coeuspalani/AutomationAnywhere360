# My Automation Anywhere Journey

This repository is a collection of personal notes, documentation, and process observations from my experience learning and building with Automation Anywhere Community Edition. It serves as a reflective archive of how I approached automation tasks, understood RPA concepts, and navigated through the platformâ€™s tools and challenges.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- Word documents describing each bot or process I attempted
- Observations about the platform and its behavior
- Lessons learned during development
- Reflections on failed attempts and how they were resolved
- Screenshots or illustrations where applicable

All content is written from a first-hand learning perspective and is intended to help others who are beginning their journey in RPA using Automation Anywhere.

## Purpose

This documentation was created primarily for:

- Tracking personal progress and understanding
- Revisiting older bots and logic for future reference

- Building a solid foundation in RPA practices
